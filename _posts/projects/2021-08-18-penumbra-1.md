<p>For the first iteration of Penumbra, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lunalyuuu/">酸拇指</a> will perform an ambient live set, followed by a screening of Ciro Guerra’s film <em>Embrace of the Serpent</em> (2015), a hypnotic exploration of the catastrophic impacts of colonialism in the Amazon. With incredibly detailed sound design by Carlos E. García and a soundtrack by Nascuy Linares featuring field recordings from indigenous Amazon communities, the film demanded us to play it through the Elevator sound system. The night finishes with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justyinan/">Yinan</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachelrach_/">Venus Flytrap</a> for you to dance yourself out of the rainforest and back into Shanghai.</p>
