<p>For the fourth iteration of Penumbra (魑魅魍魉), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zuihitsu/">Yamal</a> will play an ambient set, followed by a short film program curated by <a href="https://capsuleshanghai.com/artists/39-alice-wang/overview/">Alice Wang</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Size determines an object, but scale determines art. A crack in the wall if viewed in terms of scale, not size, could be called the Grand Canyon. A room could be made to take on the immensity of the solar system. Scale depends on one’s capacity to be conscious of the actualities of perception.<br><br>— Robert Smithson</blockquote>

<p>Through visual representation and sensory encounter, three films explore mechanically informed modes of experiencing shifts in temporal and spatial scales via the cinematic form. The filmmakers each offer a different perspective on the kinaesthetic experience of traveling across vast distances in time and space that flickers between the real and the imaginary.</p>

<p>Our afterparty is an experimental performance by Classroom Duo, who will play an adversarial game in which an experienced DJ tries to teach an amateur DJ how to mix, without ruining the dancefloor.</p>
