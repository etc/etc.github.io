<p>For the second iteration of Penumbra, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zuihitsu/">Yamal</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/knopha/">Knopha</a> will play ambient sets, followed by a screening of Jeremy Shawâ€™s film <em>Quickeners</em> (2014), constructed with appropriated footage from the ethnographic film <em>Holy Ghost People</em> (1967), about a snake-handling Pentecostal community in rural USA. Transformed into a documentary set 500 years into the future, when humans have been replaced by a post-human collectivity called The Hive, the film describes a renegade community who seek Quickening, in which long extinct human rituals and their ecstatic states may be re-experienced. The soundtrack to the film itself contributes to the sense of post-human disorientation, with scrambled speech gradually transforming into a looming climax. At the afterparty controls will be <a href="https://soundcloud.com/frauhilda">Frau</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachelrach_/">Venus Flytrap</a>, to preserve your ecstatic state.</p>
