<p>For the fifteenth Penumbra (魑魅魍魉), and our last at Elevator, we present a Christmas Eve special, featuring ambient sets from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mnmlssgs/">Chris SSG</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_rainsoft/">Rainsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zuihitsu/">Yamal</a>.</p>

<p>Penumbra (魑魅魍魉) is sad to be leaving Elevator, which will close at the end of the year. But we are very happy to end our run by welcoming back <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mnmlssgs/">Chris SSG</a> from Tokyo. Chris has supported us from the beginning, playing an absolutely beautiful long set in <a href="https://penumbra.events/penumbra-11/">May</a>, and contributing two mixes to our <a href="https://baihui.live/hosts/penumbra-radio/en/">series on Baihui</a> (listen <a href="https://baihui.live/shows/penumbra-radio-w-chris-ssg-22-03-06/en/">here</a> and <a href="https://baihui.live/shows/penumbra-radio-w-chris-ssg-23-05-07/en/">here</a>). On Sunday, he'll have the controls for as long as he wants them.</p>

<p>We are also very happy to welcome back Shanghai local <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_rainsoft/">Rainsoft</a>, who played one of our <a href="https://penumbra.events/penumbra-5/">earliest afterparties</a> (as 十一), and more recently a <a href="https://penumbra.events/penumbra-12/">lovely ambient liveset</a>. This time around, she'll play an ambient DJ set.</p>

<p>Opening is our usual suspect <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zuihitsu/">Yamal</a>. If the old Elevator weren't a short walk from his apartment, and if he didn't run into Chris at a Tokyo club in 2018, Penumbra (魑魅魍魉) would not exist. He's happy it does.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mnmlssgs/">Chris SSG</a> is the co-founder of <a href="http://mnmlssg.blogspot.com">MNML SSGS</a>, currently exploring the edges of techno music in Tokyo.</p>

<span class="h2">Bio: Rainsoft</span>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_rainsoft/">Rainsoft</a>是现居上海的音乐制作人。她从深邃的Ambient与Techno音乐中汲取灵感，以她充满灵性的感知，探索自身与音乐的连接。她的音乐冷静与柔性并存，灵动的氛围交织变幻，细微的思想潜伏于每个音符深 处。她关注于音乐更深层次的表达，在开始与发展之间追求一种无限。
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_rainsoft/">Rainsoft</a> is a musician based in Shanghai. She acquires inspiration from deep ambient and techno music. Exploring through spiritual sensations, her music is calm and gentle, with a dynamic and fluctuating atmosphere. Subtle thoughts lie low in every note. She cares most about expressing deeper thoughts through her music, pursuing the infinity between beginning and development.</p>

<span class="h2">Bio: Yamal</span>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/zuihitsu/">Yamal</a> constructs sets with a sense of space and rhythm that don’t require you to dance. You can, though, especially when it's Christmas.</p>
