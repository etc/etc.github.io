<p>The eighth iteration of Penumbra (魑魅魍魉) is a special one, as we help our friends at Elevator celebrate their 6 year anniversary.</p>
  
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/zuihitsu/">Yamal</a> will open, followed by a short film program curated by <a href="https://twitter.com/bognamk">Bogna Konior</a>, a special ambient set from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zhiqiang_lyu/">Lyu Zhi-Qiang</a> and an afterparty set from Shanghai favourite <a href="https://www.instagram.com/illsee9119/">Illsee</a>. Live visuals all night long will be provided by Penumbra resident <a href-="https://www.instagram.com/yiran_eva/">Yiran</a>.</p>

<p>Who, or what, comes after the human? The film program will feature a selection of short videos that explore posthumanism, traversing topics such as the future evolution of humanity, technobiological mutation, alternate cosmologies, artificial intelligence, digital sorcery, and cyberfeminism. <em>Post</em> humanism might be taken literally as that which arrives after the end of the human species, or philosophically, as a perspective that proposes that humanism is no longer a useful lens through which to view the world. The works selected represent the emergent genre of digital theory-fiction, which combines cybercultural aesthetics, science-fiction, and philosophy; and where text and image are equally important. At the unlikely intersection of hallucinatory visions and scholarly studies, we can think our unknown future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/zuihitsu/">Yamal</a> constructs sets with a sense of space and rhythm that don’t require you to dance. You can, though.</p>

<span class="h2">Bio: Illsee</span>

<p>Illsee，(学名:老慢) 是一种生长于长江三角洲东部城市上海的灵长目人科人属及直立行走的物种。与其他高等灵长类动物一样，Illsee是社会性的动物。深受早期工业音乐的影响，擅长用80年代至今的各式流行或非流行歌曲，向其他灵长类动物表达自我、交换意见以及组织。Illsee常在夜晚活动，因为她会捕捉迷失在街头、有害市容、扰乱其他灵长类动物生活作息的成年男女性，所以被认为是有益的。</p>

<p>Illsee, scientific name 老慢, is an upright-walking primate, born and raised in the easternmost city of the Yangtze River Delta, Shanghai. Like other primates, Illsee is a social animal. She is known for her skill at using popular and non-mainstream music from the 80s to the present-day to express herself, exchange ideas and organize with other primates.  Illsee is active at night, because she is able to capture adult men and women lost in the streets, who might otherwise harm the city and disrupt the lives of their fellow primates. As a result her activities are considered to be beneficial.</p>

<span class="h2">Bio: Yiran</span>

<p>Yiran是一位角落间的视觉收集者，擅长在各种公园偷窥无辜路人。从纽约的华盛顿广场到上海的复兴公园，没有一位大妈或小伙儿幸免。收集来的路人时而在她的画面和实验短片中出现，也在少许国际冷门电影节或某迪吧上再次亮相。</p>

<p><a href-="https://www.instagram.com/yiran_eva/">Yiran</a> is an itinerant visual collector, adept at spying on innocent passers-by in various parks. From Washington Square Park in New York to FuXing Park in Shanghai, no old lady or young man ever escaped. The collected passers-by occasionally appear in her drawings and experimental short films, and have reappeared at a handful of international film festivals and local clubs.</p>
