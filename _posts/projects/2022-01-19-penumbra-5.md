<p>For the fifth iteration of Penumbra (魑魅魍魉), we present a special performance by <a href="https://www.laneshiotayonii.com/">Otay:onii</a> with Zhuo and <a href="https://yiranguoart.com/">Yiran</a>.</p>

<p>此次表演是基于白雪公主原型的重新想象。活动的七个小矮人，白雪公主以及后母之间到底是怎么样的关系呢？毒苹果的味道如何？这将会是将会为你奉上一出声色味十足的沉浸式表演。</p>

<p>The performance reimagines the story of Snow White, twisting the details and casting new light on well-known characters: you will discover a new relationship between Snow White and her step-mother, a new view of the princess, and a new taste of the poisoned apple. The performance will be fully immersive, mixing unexpected sound and visuals with unforgettable tastes and smells.</p>

<p>Featuring special drinks provided by <a href="https://instagram.com/drowsy_office">Vis</a>, and an afterparty with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shiyi0616">11 (十一)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.laneshiotayonii.com/">Otay:onii</a>  (施金豆)，出生于浙江海宁，常驻纽约。她同时也是美国噪音朋克、自赏黑金属<a href="https://elizabethcolourwheel.bandcamp.com/">Elizabeth Colour Wheel</a>乐际的主唱。施金豆曾柴获两届努瑞安德森女性科技奖，Global Music Award的最佳女声铜奖，与 Audiovisual Arts Industrial Incubator 最佳馨音金奖等。她在电子、气氛、音效拼贴甚至噪音等众多元素里穿梭游离，不断打破边界后又重新构建，在尖锐的直觉下企图用身体见证心与思的合并，并且在此构建真诚温床上值得回顾的历史，追寻着迸裂出裂缝的那一束光，和其最荡漾的回声。</p>

<p><a href="https://www.laneshiotayonii.com/">Otay:onii</a> (Lane Shi Otayonii) was born in Haining, China, and has recently been a resident of New York and Shanghai. She is the vocalist for punk, metal and shoegaze band <a href="https://elizabethcolourwheel.bandcamp.com/">Elizabeth Colour Wheel</a> (US), and has received awards for both her production and her vocals. Working across electronic, ambient, sound collage and noise, Otay:onii breaks down structures with the aim of synchronising the heart and mind.</p>

<p>⽣生⻓长于中国旧⼯工业基地的Zhuo将电⼦子乐和各类⺠民族⾳音乐做融合与拼接。从南美的丛林林迷幻到北北亚的雪国萨满，她擅⻓长⽤用原始节拍唤醒意识深处被遗忘的感官。引领你在本能的舞蹈与宁静的观想中跳跃，跟随⼤大地的脉动，游牧到⽆无境之地。</p>

<p>Growing up in the old industrial base of China, Zhuo combines electronic music with various forms of folk music, from the jungle psychedelia of South America to the snow shamans of North Asia. She deploys original beats to awaken forgotten senses in the depths of consciousness, leading you to leap in instinctive dance and serene contemplation. By following the pulse of the earth, she’ll make you a nomad in a borderless territory.</p>

<p><a href="https://yiranguoart.com/">Yiran</a> is an itinerant visual collector, adept at spying on innocent passers-by in various locations. From Washington Square Park in New York to FuXing Park in Shanghai, no old lady or young man has ever escaped. The collected passers-by occasionally appear in her drawings and experimental short films, and have reappeared at a handful of international film festivals and local clubs.</p>
