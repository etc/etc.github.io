I"Y<p>For the first iteration of Penumbra, 酸拇指 will perform an ambient live set, followed by a screening of Ciro Guerra’s film <em>Embrace of the Serpent</em> (2015), a hypnotic exploration of the catastrophic impacts of colonialism in the Amazon. With incredibly detailed sound design by Carlos E. García and a soundtrack by Nascuy Linares featuring field recordings from indigenous Amazon communities, the film demanded us to play it through the Elevator sound system. The night finishes with Yinan and Venus Flytrap for you to dance yourself out of the rainforest and back into Shanghai.</p>
